No sleep
No sleep until I'm done with finding the answer
Won't stop
Won't stop before I find a cure for this cancer
Sometimes
I feel like going down and so disconnected
Somehow
I know that I am haunted to be wanted

I've been watching, I've been waiting
In the shadows for my time
I've been searching, I've been living
For tomorrow's all my life

In the shadows

In the shadows


I've been watching, I've been waiting
In the shadows for my time
I've been searching, I've been living
For tomorrow's all my life

In the shadows

In the shadows
